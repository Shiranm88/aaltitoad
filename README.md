# MAVE
(Model Agnostic Verification Engine) - This is a work in progress. I will likely abandon this project in 2 days.

## Compile
First, make sure that you have initialized all git submodules.
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
If you want to compile release version, simply do:
```
make RELEASE=1
```

## Install
This will install \<NAME IS WIP\> to `/usr/local/bin/` or `REDACTED` on windows/macOS  
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```
